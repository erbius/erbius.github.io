<h1> Guide to Things MiFare Classic </h1>

## These pages are meant to document how to use the Proxmark3 (PM3) with various types of MiFare Classic cards and provide understanding of Mifare Classic.
## The information detailed here has been collected from a variety of sources as well as lots of experimenting with the Proxmark.

## This guide hopes to be as comprehensive as possible and aims to have all relevant information in one place. Thus mitigating sporadic information coming from a variety of different sources that arent maintained.

## The Proxmark3 (RDV4 version) is the only tool used in this guide and will not work for other devices.
## The PM3 client is running on a Linux OS and is regularly kept up to date in line with new changes to the [RRG Repo](https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/proxmark3).

## All setup, PM3 troubleshooting and questions should be directed at the maintainers of the [RRG repo](https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/proxmark3). This guide works on the assumption of a successfully setup and working Proxmark along with the client. Both of which should be kept up to date.
